Phu's Experiments

Phu's second experiments

## Important Notes
- This is a super important API
- Books are life
- Remember to hydrate
- Coffee is basically a vegetable
- The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell
- Pizza counts as a balanced meal (it has all food groups!)
- Debugging is just being the detective in a crime movie where you're also the murderer
- There are only 10 types of people: those who understand binary and those who don't
- Always code as if the person maintaining your code is a violent psychopath who knows where you live
