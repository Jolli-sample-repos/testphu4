# Intersection

## Analysis

Based on the recent commits and Linear tickets:

**Potential Impact:**

1. **JOLLI-51 & JOLLI-50** (README.md updates) could potentially relate to:
   - **JOLLI-122** (Add Source Docs Backend) - README documentation changes might need to be reflected in source documentation
   - **JOLLI-123** (Github Repo Globs) - README updates could affect how repo patterns are documented or configured

2. **JOLLI-50** (server.js modifications) could potentially relate to:
   - **JOLLI-121** (Rename ARN to JRN throughout the codebase) - [NOW DONE] - Server.js changes should be verified to ensure they use the new JRN naming convention instead of ARN
   - **JOLLI-122** (Add Source Docs Backend) - Server-side changes might interact with the new source docs backend functionality
   - **JOLLI-123** (Github Repo Globs) - Server modifications could affect how repo glob patterns are processed

3. **Critical comment added to server.js** could relate to:
   - **JOLLI-121** (Rename ARN to JRN throughout the codebase) - [NOW DONE] - The critical comment should be reviewed to ensure it uses correct naming conventions
   - **JOLLI-122** (Add Source Docs Backend) - Any critical server logic should be compatible with the new docs backend

**Recommendations:**

- ✅ Review server.js changes from JOLLI-50 and the critical comment to ensure they use JRN instead of ARN naming (JOLLI-121 is now complete)
- Check if README.md changes from JOLLI-51 and JOLLI-50 need to be incorporated into the source docs backend (JOLLI-122)
- Verify that server.js modifications are compatible with Github Repo Globs functionality (JOLLI-123)
- Ensure all recent code changes follow the new JRN naming convention throughout

## Analysis

Based on the recent commits and Linear tickets:

Potential Impact:

JOLLI-51 & JOLLI-50 (README.md updates) could potentially relate to:JOLLI-118 (New docsite creation) - The README.md changes from both commits should be reviewed and potentially incorporated into the new docsite contentJOLLI-120 (Automatically kick off initial article creation jobs) - README documentation changes might affect how initial article creation is triggeredJOLLI-50 (server.js modifications) could potentially relate to:JOLLI-119 (Race condition on oauth flow) - [NOW DONE] - The server.js changes should be verified to ensure they don't conflict with the oauth flow fixes that were completedJOLLI-117 (Create draft on Update trigger) - Server-side changes might affect trigger mechanismsCritical comment added to server.js could relate to:JOLLI-119 (Race condition on oauth flow) - [NOW DONE] - The critical comment should be reviewed to ensure it aligns with the completed oauth flow fixes

Recommendations:

Review the server.js changes from JOLLI-50 and the critical comment to verify they are compatible with the completed oauth flow fix for JOLLI-119Check if README.md changes from JOLLI-51 and JOLLI-50 need to be incorporated into the new docsite (JOLLI-118)Verify that server.js modifications don't impact the Update trigger functionality (JOLLI-117)Consider if README changes affect the automatic article creation job kickoff logic (JOLLI-120)

## Analysis

Based on the recent commits and Linear tickets:

Potential Impact:

JOLLI-51 & JOLLI-50 (README.md updates) could potentially relate to:JOLLI-118 (New docsite creation) - The README.md changes from both commits should be reviewed and potentially incorporated into the new docsite contentJOLLI-115 (Article Draft) - Documentation updates might affect article drafts being createdJOLLI-50 (server.js modifications) could potentially relate to:JOLLI-119 (Race condition on oauth flow) - If the server.js changes touched authentication or request handling logic, they might interact with the oauth flow race conditionJOLLI-117 (Create draft on Update trigger) - Server-side changes might affect trigger mechanismsCritical comment added to server.js could relate to:JOLLI-119 (Race condition on oauth flow) - The critical comment should be reviewed to ensure it doesn't conflict with oauth flow fixes

Recommendations:

Review the server.js changes from JOLLI-50 and the critical comment to ensure they don't interfere with the oauth flow fix for JOLLI-119Check if README.md changes from JOLLI-51 and JOLLI-50 need to be incorporated into the new docsite (JOLLI-118) and article drafts (JOLLI-115)Verify that server.js modifications don't impact the Update trigger functionality (JOLLI-117)

## Analysis

Based on the recent commits and Linear tickets:

Potential Impact:

JOLLI-50 commit (Add essential improvements and motivational messages) modified server.js and README.md. This could potentially relate to:JOLLI-119 (Race condition on oauth flow) - If the server.js changes touched authentication or request handling logic, they might interact with the oauth flow race conditionJOLLI-118 (New docsite creation) - The README.md updates might be documentation-related and could affect docsite content

Recommendations:

Review the server.js changes from JOLLI-50 to ensure they don't interfere with the oauth flow fix for JOLLI-119Check if README.md changes need to be incorporated into the new docsite (JOLLI-118)The "critical comment" added to server.js in the second commit should be reviewed for any security or performance implications related to ongoing tickets

```joi
check out this repo with your tool https://github.com/jolliai/example-express-js then:

1. get this article
2. Create a Release Notes section with Dates, the commit message, and files changed. Keep only the last 3. Update section if necessary, put it in a nice markdown table format if it's not like that already.
3. pull the latest linear tickets and put them in the # Updated section (have the last 5), put them in a nice table format in markdown
4. Look at section 2 and 3 and see if there are potential changes that will change the ticket. Put that in # Intersection
5. Don't mess with other sections.
```
